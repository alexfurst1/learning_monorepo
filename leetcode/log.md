# Leetcode Log
## This is where I keep track of work on difficult problems so I can go back and study them

### ** TO STUDY LIST:
- 3sum, need to write from scratch. check explanation from chatGPT. (should be under Q and A)


### 9/18
* 3sum - problem 15
 * array two pointer, sorting (kinda)
 * I understand how I need to fix the first index, then use two pointer to search over the rest
 * I am having trouble understanding removing and preventing duplicates
 * also syntax issues because I'm not the best coder yet
 * i get it for the most part but will most likely forget by tomorrow

* 3sumClosest - problem 16
 * pretty easy for me since I understood the two pointer algorithm with 3 items, learned from the 3sum algo
 * was having trouble on how to compare ranges. My first idea was to have sum and temp set to 0, but I'd have nothing to compare off of.
 * aha moment was setting sum to nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] so no matter what it might be valid, unlike setting sum to 0.
 - completed in about 35 minutes with 1 hint from chatGPT (it actually told me to set sum to nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]) so ig it did all the work
  - note: whenever I do ask chat for help, I send my code and ask "for a nudge in the right direction" maybe I should change to "give a hint without revealing anything to me"
