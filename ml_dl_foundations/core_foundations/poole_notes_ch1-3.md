Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the field that studies *the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently*

An **agent** is something that acts in an environment and does something. 
    - like a dog, bird, or cat. They exist, and they do stuff

Intelligence is a matter of degree, based on:
- if what it does is appropriate for its circumstances, its goals, and its perpetual and computational limits
- it takes into account the consequences of its actions, both short and long term, including its effects on itself, others, and the environment
- it learns from experience
- it can change with the environment and changing goals

A **computational agent** is an agent whose decisons can be explained as a series of computations. This means its decision making process can be broken down into primitive operations, and implemented into some sort of device.

The central scientific goal of AI is to understand what makes intelligent behavior possible in natural or artificial systems.

Honestly, it should be to what makes intelligent thought possible, although the textbook says this is not what the definition means. However, that is what I am ultimately interested in.

The central engineering goal of AI is the design and synthesis of agents that act intelligently.
